 Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission Officer Certification Cases

# Certification
As a condition of employment, all Washington peace and corrections officers are required to maintain certification granted by the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission (WSCJTC). The WSCJTC reviews and investigates complaints and law enforcement agency reports alleging officer misconduct. The WSCJTC may deny or revoke the certification of, or require remedial training for, any officer found to have committed qualifying misconduct under RCW 43.101.105.   

This database contains information on all certification cases investigated by the WSCJTC. 

NOTE: Cases that are not closed with a final order finding of committed misconduct are not proof that an officer engaged in misconduct.

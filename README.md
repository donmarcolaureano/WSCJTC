# WSCJTC
 Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission Officer Certification Cases

# Certification
As a condition of employment, all Washington peace and corrections officers are required to maintain certification granted by the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission (WSCJTC). The WSCJTC reviews and investigates complaints and law enforcement agency reports alleging officer misconduct. The WSCJTC may deny or revoke the certification of, or require remedial training for, any officer found to have committed qualifying misconduct under RCW 43.101.105.   

This database contains information on all certification cases investigated by the WSCJTC. 

NOTE: Cases that are not closed with a final order finding of committed misconduct are not proof that an officer engaged in misconduct.

Investigation - A allegation of misconduct has been assigned to an investigator to conduct a fair, independent, objective, and thorough investigation.  

Statement of Charges – A Statement of Charges (SOC) has been served notifying the officer of misconduct allegations against them and beginning the administrative process for de-certification.  A SOC is issued when a WSCJTC investigation concludes that qualifying misconduct more likely than not occurred and it is determined there is cause to believe an officer’s certification should be denied, suspended, or revoked, or that remedial training should be required.

Certification Hearing – The case is scheduled for an administrative hearing to determine whether RCW 43.101.105 misconduct occurred, and if so, what sanctions commensurate to the wrongdoing will be imposed by WSCJTC.

Cleared – The case does not meet the preponderance of evidence standard.  Preponderance of the evidence means the evidence suggests it is more likely than not that the certified officer engaged in the alleged misconduct in violation of RCW 43.101.105.
